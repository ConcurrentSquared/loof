<h1>The Rules of Loof</h1>
<aside>To see more specific details about Loof's rules, please take a look at Loof's <a href="https://www.concurrentsquared.com/loof/tos">terms of service</a>.</aside>
<p>The rules of Loof are simple:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not post inappropriate content; all content on Loof should be safe to read at work. We will not hold you accountable if you accidentally generate inappropriate AI content, though.</li>
	<li>Do not post or intentionally generate harmful content - by harmful, we mean content that can be used in order to cause significant harm to a person, group of people, or humanity if public. Note that this does not include non-credible infohazards.</li>
	<li>Do not post or intentionally generate offensive content; content on Loof should not offend anyone of any background.</li>
	<li>Do not post spam. Spam generally includes anything to do with cryptocurrency tokens, any <em>extremely</em> common query, any attempt to shill stuff, or anything else that unfairly harms Loof as a service. AI-generated shilling is allowed, if the shilling has a modicrum of literary valie.</li>
	<li>Do not post copyrighted content (or content that you want to copyright); you have to release any content you post to Loof to CC0, a public-domain equivalent license.
		<aside>However, small excerpts of copyrighted content are allowed, if these excerpts can be covered by fair use, fair dealing, or the right to quote.</aside>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The above shows perma-bannable offenses. Below are less important rules; breaking these rules will most likely result in a removed node or 24-hour suspension, at worst:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not obscure other people's nodes with your node. We will manually move your node.</li>
	<li>Do not generate an excessive amount of AI-generated text.</li>
</ul>
